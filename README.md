# Charmander-Pokedex

## Design Process 
- Colortheme : We chose a light warm color theme to match the color of the pokemon charmander.
- Layout: We wanted a simple layout for all pages so it was easy on the eyes.

## HomePage

- We first decided on creating a landing page with 3 pokemon icons that are linked to seperate pages.
- Then we decided on a orange to yellow gradient background.
- We got the Pokemon font to match the theme.
## Cardpages

For the cardpages we wanted a simple dual tone layout that displayed all of the important information. We used a very light orange and yellow combination for the card. We experimented with a black color for our font but then shifted into using a white font color with a small text shadow. Ontop of changing our font color with changed our font to an all caps slanted thick modern font.
